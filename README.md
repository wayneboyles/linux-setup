# Linux Setup Script

A simple project I am working on in my spare time.  I find myself installing the same software and configurations on various Linux Distros, so I figured I would script it instead to make things easier on myself.

Run the following command to download and run the setup script which will download all of the required supporting files.  Nothing will be installed by this script, only files from this repository will be downloaded.

```console
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayneboyles/linux-setup/main/setup.sh | bash -s
```
